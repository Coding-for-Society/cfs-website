    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
      Education is key to a successful future.<br />
      This is why we are working on projects to get children excited about coding and to help them
      learn the basics.
      At the same time we are also sharing knowledge between our members to learn from each other
      and improve our skills.

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      With our projects, we aim to make technology and software in particular accessible to
      everyone.<br />
      This is also why all of our projects are open source.
