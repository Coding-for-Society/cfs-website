# The website of Coding for Scoiety
The website of Coding for Society, which is also our first project over all.

## Purpose and goals of our website
The website should serve as a portfolio in the first place: We will share our projects, cooperations and 
current information about our team there. However, it's also our digital business card and shall be shared whenever 
we want to introduce our project to someone. Later on, there might even be a blog or learning materials, but that's future thoughts.

## Tech stack
The frontend is built using the frontend framework react while 
for the backend we use firebase, which is also the place our website is hosted.
